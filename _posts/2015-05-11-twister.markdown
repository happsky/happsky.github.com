## Multimedia

If we had to choose one word to describe Twister that would be it.
Twister is a theme that focusses on multimedia. It contains different
post types to create video posts, audio posts, image post or gallery
posts with ease. We created a ton of Variables, that make customization
super easy.

This theme is powerful and it comes with a few extras.

## Features

The theme comes with a grunt file, which means that working with it is
super easy. We have Tasks that compile, concatenate, minify and even
deploy to GitHub, with or without plugins. You also get our Sass
folder, which makes changing the looks of the site super easy.

### Front Matter Generator

Twister comes with a front matter generator that will make generating
the front matter for each post a breeze. So you don't have to remember
each and every variable name, the generator will help you with that.

### Extensive Documentation

We don't believe in delivering Code without explanation. So we wrote an
extensive Documentation for Twister that goes over every single step
from installing all of the dependencies to explaining how to customize,
create posts and publish. We even tell you how you can host Twister
with Plugins on GitHub pages.

Check the [Docs](http://twister.digitalmind.ch/documentation/) out.

### Feedback, Wishes, Problems

If you run into any trouble or have a request please do so by opening
up an issue on the theme's GitHub page. If you just want to give us a
general feedback feel free to [contact
