BlackDoc is a two-column black theme with a scrolling sidebar. It's
ideal for websites that require a master-detail layout for viewing of
content, e.g. documentation, cheatsheets, lyrics, notes, etc.

It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler, and the
[Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com) theme.

## BlackDoc Features

In addition to the features of [Poole](http://getpoole.com) and
[Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com), BlackDoc theme adds the following:

* Scrolling sidebar with a thin scrollbar to allow displaying of
  numerous top-level content.
* Elements and classes of the Hyde theme were updated to look great in
  black background. Check out the demo to see the stylings used in the
  theme.
