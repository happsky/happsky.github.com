Uno-dbyll is a simple, clean, responsive and stylist theme for jekyll.

The [theme demo site](http://blog.ankanbiswas.in/uno-dbyll) is my
source code for personal blogging, build and hosted with Jekyll.

I started this _project as a part of my learning and curiosity. Many
thanks to _Ä°smail_Demirbilek for his responsive website on Jekyll and
providing his blog as a reference.

I would also like to thank Dale-Anthony for the his awesome website as
a next-reference.
