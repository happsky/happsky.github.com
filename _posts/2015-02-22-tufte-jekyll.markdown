### Tufte-Jekyll theme

The Tufte-Jekyll theme is a natural extension of the work done by Dave
Leipmann on Github after he created a CSS file that allows web writers
to use the simple and elegant style employed by Edward Tufte in his
published materials. Tufte’s style is known for its extensive use of
sidenotes, tight integration of graphics with text, and well-set
typography. The idea for this project is essentially cribbed wholesale
from Tufte and R Markdown’s Tufte Handout format.

The Jekyll theme adds custom Liquid tags which combine with
Github-flavored Markdown and allow an author to write elegant technical
work without the need for a lot of hairy HTML.

### Contribute

Fork the repo and put your mad Ruby skillz to work. Some of the liquid
tags could be sexed up considerably. For instance, the sidenote tag
amped-up with the ability to auto-create numbering would be a huge
boon.
