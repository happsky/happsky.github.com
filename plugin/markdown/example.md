# Project Timeline

Our semester long project proceeded in the following chronological order

1. August/September - collect data and formulate a well defined problem statement
2. October - Explore various segmentation methods to identify feature edges in micrographs
3. November - Develop relevant statistics based on calculating chord length distributions. Begin data reduction in PC space. Some other exploratory statistics that failed (see below).
4. December - Finalize data reduction tasks in PC space. Explore machine learning possibilities from given data set. Develop visualizations and presentation.

# Machining Introduction

Machining is a secondary manufacturing operation that typically follows primary shaping processes such as casting or forging. Imposed strains and strain rates can be as large as 10^5 1/s and 1-15, respectively. During these extreme deformation conditions significant energy is dissipated through plastic work which increases the temperatures in the chip. 

The described strain-rate-temperature conditions define a thermomechanical processing route that is unique to machining. 

Measured shear strain rates  for oxygen-free high-conductivity (OFHC) copper. Note that velocimetry techniques are limited to lower machining speeds; in this case a 0.01 m/s speed was utilized. Industrial applications maching at 3-5 m/s where strain rates may approach 10^5 1/s.

Measured shear strains for this set of experiments fall in the 3-12 range.

# Processing Effects on Microstructure

The imposed thermomechanical processing route can induce significant microstructural changes in both the machined workpiece and the produced chip. Microstructural changes may include but are not limited to,

- Grain refinement
- Increase in dislocation density
- Increase in twin density
