>问题：定语从句和同位语从句很多时候都是一个名词+that引导的从句，怎么区分？

回答：同位语从句的从句是解释前面的名词（譬如说the fact, the idea, the evidence）等。

定语从句的从句是限定前面的名词。

在结构上，同位语从句因为是名词性从句，从句是独立的句子。

定语从句的从句一般缺少主语或者宾语。

students who cannot afford tuition fees.(T, 先行词充当从句主语)

>问题：同位语从句可以用trend,problem来引导吗？

回答：一般不可以。不是随便一个名词加一个that的从句就是同位语从句。

一般来说，fact,news,idea,doubt,message,view,notion,suggestion这些表示看法、观点一类的词可以引导同位语从句。

#### 限制性定语从句（不加逗号）VS非限制（加逗号）

This explains why many countries (T, 宾语从句)

This is why many countries (T, 表语从句)
 
this is the reason that many countries (F, This is the reason why)

There are many people today cannot maintain a high level of physical activity.(F, There be修饰后面，不能加完整的句子)

There are many people who cannot maintain a high level of physical activity today.(T, 定语从句, there be句型实际上是倒装, 原句是many people are there, 先行词充当主语)

There is a large number of people who cannot maintain a high level of physical activity today.(F, 主语是people,要用are)

>There be 句型中的be 应和其后出现的主语在数上一致，即“就近原则”

### 第十四课 句子的连接（连词，连接词，标点符号）和复杂句的分析

我们不断被电话打扰，但是我们试试分依赖电话。

We are constantly distracted by phone calls ... we rely on mobile devices.

. Even though (F)

. While (F, while是从属连词，后半句没有主句了)

, on the other hand, (F, on the other hand也是副词短语,第一个逗号改成分号)

, nevertheless (F, nevertheless也是副词短语,第一个逗号改成分号)

人们的收入越来越高，因此，他们购物更加多了。

. Therefore,(T)

, because of this, (F, 改成分号)

, as a consequence, (F, 改成分号)

, so (T, 连词)

>当两个句子都是独立时, 逗号就一定得在but, and, also, as well as, because, so 
等等词后面用上,如果是用however, therefore, thus, on the other hand诸如此类的, 其实是要用;分号

#### 如何分析复杂句？

- 如果出现that引导的名词性从句，主要是看`从句是否有独立的句子`
- 如果出现了状语从句，`从句和主句都需要是独立的句子`
- 如果出现了定语从句，1使用还原检查从句准确性2去掉从句`看主句是否是独立的句子`
- 如果是并列句（and,or,but）等，1前后的分句没有共用任何成分，前后要有独立的句子2前后的分句有公共的成分，那么这个时候`去掉并列的成分`，句子要独立
- 所谓的独立句子，`就是去掉所有修饰成分之后，举止要符合单句的基本结构`

Many people have chosen to move to other countries, but many of them have problems in overcoming cultural shocks.

They can improve their grades at school and achieve success in future jobs.(They can improve their grades at school.(T))
