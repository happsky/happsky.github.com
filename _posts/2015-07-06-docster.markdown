## Simple and easy

That's how we would describe working with docster.

We first created it, when we needed an index file for a theme
documentation. jekyll offered collections which made the organization
into smaller chunks of documentation optimal. Especially because the
collections did not generate outputs for themselves.

This theme was created to generate an organized output. It does not
require any plugins, which means you can host on GitHub without much
effort.

## Features

* Nice syntax highlighting
* dynamic multi-level navigation
* Sass stylesheets

### Documentation

We don't believe in delivering Code without explanation. Especially not
for a documentation theme. So the
[Demo](http://digitalmind.ch/themes/docster-jekyll-theme/demo/) doubles
as the documentation for Docster, that should help you set up your own
docs without any problems.

### Feedback, Wishes, Problems

If you run into any trouble or have a request please do so by opening
up an issue on the theme's GitHub page.
If you just want to give us a general feedback feel free to [contact us!](http://digitalmind.ch/contact/)
